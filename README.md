Project 1: Image Edge Detection
I used Python and OpenCV for this project to identify edges in images, which is crucial for applications like x-rays, self-driving cars, and robotics. The program reads a JPG image, applies Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral blurring to reduce noise, and then uses Canny edge detection. Finally, the result is displayed using Matplotlib.
Required Libraries- cv2, matplotlib
